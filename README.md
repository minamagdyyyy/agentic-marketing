# Agentic Marketing Suite

A modular suite of Claude Code skills for full-stack marketing — from strategic planning through channel execution, measurement, and automation. Each skill is a specialist that can be invoked independently or routed to by the agency coordinator.

## Installation

Install all skills into your project with one command:

```bash
npx skills add gnoviawan/agentic-marketing
```

Or install globally (available in every project):

```bash
npx skills add gnoviawan/agentic-marketing --global
```

Install a specific skill only:

```bash
npx skills add gnoviawan/agentic-marketing --skill marketing-sostac
npx skills add gnoviawan/agentic-marketing --skill marketing-seo
```

> Skills are installed to `.claude/skills/` in your project, or `~/.claude/skills/` globally. Requires [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code).

## Brand Workspaces

All brand-specific work lives in `brands/{brand-slug}/` and is **gitignored** — client data never enters version control.

```
brands/{brand-slug}/
├── brand-context.md             # Core brand info, tone, positioning
├── research-*.md                # Research files
└── sostac/                      # SOSTAC plan (created by marketing-sostac)
    ├── README.md                # Phase completion tracker
    ├── 00-auto-discovery.md     # Pre-interview research
    ├── 01-situation.md
    ├── 02-objectives.md
    ├── 03-strategy.md
    ├── 04-tactics.md
    ├── 05-action.md
    ├── 06-control.md
    └── plan-summary.md          # Executive summary (after all 6 phases)
```

## Skill Architecture

Each skill follows a consistent layout:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Instructions loaded into Claude's context
└── references/
    ├── frameworks.md     # Methodology detail for frameworks used
    ├── best-practices.md # Execution best practices
    └── *.md              # Additional domain-specific references
```

Skills use progressive context loading — only `SKILL.md` is in context when the skill is active; reference files are read on demand. This keeps each invocation lean while giving deep methodology access when needed.

---

## Adding a New Brand

1. Create `brands/{brand-slug}/brand-context.md` with the brand's core information
2. Run `/marketing-sostac` and tell it the brand slug — it will handle the rest
3. Brand files are local only (gitignored); back them up separately if needed

---

## Contributing

Skills are plain Markdown — edit any `skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` or its `references/` files directly. The format follows the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io/specification).
